In a standard speedrunning web site one is able to submit and view speedruns on various games. People can also typically view the rankings of all the submitted runs as well as guides that describe how the run is performed. But another thing of interest for people into speedrunning are the individual techniques performed within the runs themselves. However speedrunning websites donâ€™t offer the ability to search for information on the techniques themselves. In this website you will have the ability to not only submit and view runs but you can also view and submit techniques as their own individual submissions. You can also submit full video or written guides to a games page for people to learn from. This website will be focused on getting people into speedruns by allowing users to provide content that allows anyone to gradually learn what a speedrun is all about.
