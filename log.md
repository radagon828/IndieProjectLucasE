### Week 4
Tasks Completed:
- Created Java beans
- Created .jsps for the Home Page, Game Page, Submission pages, and the View Video page

I think I have a general idea of how I'm going to get the search engine up and running the only thing I'm anxious about 
is how I'm going to get user accounts working in this app.

### Week 5

Tasks Completed:
- Created search servlet
- added hibernate annotations to javabeans

I think I'm going to prioritize getting the database relationships in order
