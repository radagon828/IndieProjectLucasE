|Item |Considerations| Comments/Suggestions|
|--------|---------|---|
|||Reviewer comments and suggestions go here. EVERY item should have *at least* one "kudos" and one suggestion for improvement|
|**Problem Statement**|1. Accurately describes the project's purpose.<br> 2. Is professional and free of typos, slang, etc.<br> 3. Thoroughly explains the problem and the solution.<br> 4. Is understandable by the average person.|The problem statement clearly states the problem and a proposed solution. I feel like its slightly unprofessional to mention that its a school project rather then just your webapp proposal. |
|**Design Documentation**|1. Navigation/flow through the application is logical and easy to use. <br>2. The order in which values are displayed are logical and easy to understand/use <br>3. The order in which the form fields entered are logical and easy to understand/use<br>4. All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens. <br>5. Project plan and time log are up-to-date. |Your almost blank journal file threw me off but you do seem to have a plan, an up to date time log, and weekly reflection statements. I recommend updating your reflection statement as I personally find that reflecting on work you did can help you deal with a large workload in the future.  |
|**Data model/Database**|1. Everything on the screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model. <br> 2. There are at least two 1-to-many relationships.<br> 3. The model represents good database design. <br>| What is your planned database structure?|
|**Code**|1. Proper Maven project structure is used. <br> 2. a .gitignore file for IntelliJ Java projects has been implemented. <br> 3. There is not any redundant or copy/paste code in the JSPs or classes.<br> 4. Classes are appropriately-sized (no monster classes).<br> Property files are used appropriately: no hard-coded values. <br> 5. Logging statements are used rather than System.out.println and printStackTrace (be sure to use a search to look for these!).<br> 6. There are appropriate unit tests/code coverage.|You haven't created most of your classes yet so i don't have much to say. I look forward to seeing how this project turns out, its a very cool idea!|
